# CIROH Portal Deployment on AWS

## Prerequisites
- AWS Client (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- AWS access to specific account/profile (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
- Terraform (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

## Variables (terraform.tfvars) Template


```yaml
region = "aws_region"
profile = "aws_profile"
cluster_name = "tethysportal-ciroh"
app_name = "tethysportal"
helm_chart = "./helm_package.tgz"  # add helm package to working directory
helm_values_file = "./values.yaml"  # add custom values.yaml to working directory
```
or

```yaml
region = "aws_region"
profile = "aws_profile"
cluster_name = "tethysportal-ciroh"
app_name = "tethysportal"
helm_chart = "chart_name"
helm_repo = "url_to_helm_repo"
helm_values_file = "./values.yaml" # add custom values.yaml to working directory
```

## How to Run

The initial Run can be done with the following:

```bash
terraform init
terrafrom plan
terraform apply
```

In order to destroy de infrastructure run the following:

```bash
terrafrom destroy
```

After the first run, you will se the following errors:

```bash

```

The contexty deadline is only a timeout error while the second indicated is related to two load balancers(internal and internet-facing) that were not deleted with the destruction of the tethys portal. You might need to go to the AWS dashboard and delete them manually.

Run `terraform destroy` again, if the problem ios still the same delete the vpc manually and run again `terrafrom destroy`

## Configure kubectl

`aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster_name> --region <region> --profile <profile>`

## Specify kubeconfig for Terraform

- Unix: KUBE_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/kubeconfig
- Powershell: $Env:KUBE_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/kubeconfig

## TroubleShooting

- When the `terraform destroy` command does not work in one run, it can be du to a couple of reasons:
  - The ALB ingress gets destroy before, so the ingresses of the Tethys portal do nto get deleted. You might need to delete them in the AWS dashboard --> EC2--> Load Balancers
  - The VPC cannot be deleted, This is also realted to the ALB ingress being deleted before (leaving the ingresses of the Tethys Portal hanging around after the creation) As a result, the VPC is still being used by these Load Balancers. Delete the Load Balancers, and then the VPC in the AWS dashboard
- Deleting manually can sometimes cause the following error:
  - `Kubernetes cluster unreachable: invalid configuration: no configuration has been provided, try setting KUBERNETES_MASTER environment variable`
